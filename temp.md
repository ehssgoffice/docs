# Information Technology Security Policy

Policy Number: ITSP-2023-001

Policy Date:

## Policy’s Purpose

This policy provides guidelines for the protection and use of information technology assets and resources within the organization to ensure integrity, confidentiality and availability of data and assets.

## Procedures

### Physical Security

**Environmental Safeguards**

- For all servers, routers and other network assets, the area must be secured with adequate ventilation/ air-conditioning and appropriate access through security measures such as keypad, lock etc.
- All facilities with information technology assets, must have adequate fire extinguishing devices
- Critical Equipment (Network Attached Storage) must be connected to an Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) in order to prevent power spikes, power cut-out and subsequent damage to data and hardware
- Electrical outlets must not be overloaded by connecting too many devices. Proper and practical usage of extension cords are to be reviewed annually.

It will be the responsibility of the ICT Manager or the acting personnel for that position to ensure that this requirement is followed at all times. Any employee becoming aware of a breach to this security requirement is obliged to notify the ICT Manager or the supervisor (Director/ Deputy Director) immediately.

All security and safety of all portable electronic devices such as laptops/ notebooks, tablets, mobile phones issued by the EHSSG will be the responsibility of the employee. Each employee is required to a password to ensure that the asset is kept safely at all times to protect the security of the asset issued to them.

In the event of loss of damage of the electronic devices issued by the EHSSG, the ICT personnel (ICT staff, ICT officer, ICT Manager) will assess the security measures undertaken to determine if the employee will be required to reimburse the organization for the loss or damage.

### Information Security

All data of the EHSSG’s working files and folders are to be backed up. It is the responsibility of the ICT personnel (ICT staff, ICT officer, ICT manager) to ensure that data back-ups are conducted weekly and the backed up data is kept in the local network attached storage (NAS) system as well as the cloud storage.

All computers of the EHSSG must have anti-virus software installed or realtime protection enabled. Windows computers must have enabled the realtime protection of the Windows Defender. Mac computers must have enabled the Gatekeeper Protection. It is the responsibility of the ICT personnel (ICT staff, ICT officer, ICT Manager) to install or enable Anti-Virus software and ensure that this software remains up to date.

### Network Attached Storage (NAS) access

**Benefits of Storing Data on a Network Attached Storage (NAS)**

- **Restoration**
    - All data on the Solid State Drive (SSD) of the Network Attached Storage (NAS) is backed up on another Solid State Drive (SSD) of the same NAS. The data is also processed an automated backup to Google Drive owned by the organization at regular interval. In case of loss/ damage, the data can be restored.
- **Multiple Access**
    - The data on the network attached storage (NAS) can be accessed by more than one user.

**Important Considerations**

- Space Limitation
    - It is important that only the most important documents are stored there and ensure that there is no duplication. This space is meant for saving official documents which are either important and need to be retained or require access by more than one user.
- **Safety**
    - Data security is a major concern for the organization. This means not only protecting our own individual data from others but also to protect our colleague’s data from unintentional damage by us. Therefore it is absolutely imperative that whatever files we put on the server are properly scanned and cleared of viruses before they are saved. This should be done on regular intervals.
- **Restrictions**
    - Personal data is NOT allowed to be stored on the Network Attached Storage (NAS). This includes resumes (except Human Resources), personal photographs, games, personal softwares etc.
    - It is the responsibility of the ICT personnel (ICT staff, ICT officer, ICT manager) or an acting personnel for that position to remove without notice any such files found on the server
    - Change or deletion of user files for organizational purposes should NOT be done without prior approval from the creator/owner of the document.

Every employee will be issued with a unique password to access the organization’s network attached storage (NAS) and will be required to change the password every three months.

Each password is to have at least 8 characters long and composed of alphabets, numbers and special characters and is not to be shared with any employee within the organization.

The ICT personnel (ICT staff, ICT officer, ICT Manager) is responsible for issuing the initial password for all employees.

Where an employee forgets the password or is locked out after a certain number of unsuccessful login attempts then the ICT personnel (ICT staff, ICT officer, ICT Manager) is authorized to reissue a new initial password that will be required to change when the employee logs in using the new initial password.

The following diagram provides the authorization of access:

### Disaster recovery

### Electronic disaster

The lowest level of disaster is a sever crash of some sort. This has a very high likelihood of happening sometime within a 5-10 year period. It can be either physical (the server dies) or inflicted from the outside (virus, mechanical accidents, etc). In the event of such disasters, the ICT will assess the damage to the computer facility, to control and coordinate recovery/ backup actions, and to make recommendations to the Deputy Director (or) Director. The primary back-up is the reserve solid state drive (SSD) inside the same network attached storage (NAS) and the secondary back-up goes to the Google Drive cloud storage of the organization.

Backup reserve solid state drive (SSD) and Google Drive must be tested in a monthly regular basis to make sure the data is really backed up. This can be done by moving files or folders to somewhere else and then restoring the files and folders from the backup. Chances are that if the files and folders can be restored correctly, the backup system is working as intended. In case the original data is not restored correctly, the backup options must need a new set up from scratch.

### Physical/ Natural Disaster

The physical/ natural disasters include damage to information technology systems as a result of fire, flood or war. The network attached storage (NAS) of the organization is automatically backing up to the Google Drive storage. In case of damage inflicted by physical/ natural disaster to the entire information technology system including the network attached storage (NAS), the last update data from the Google Drive can be recovered.

In such cases, a computer with server capacity should be purchased locally. This computer will be used for all server applications until appropriate servers are purchased. If the entire office is destroyed as a result of the disaster then the computer will be set up in a separate area at a location away from the disaster area.

### Disaster recovery team and recovery plan requirements

The disaster recovery team will convene as soon as possible after a disaster has occurred to assess damages and make recommendations to the Director (or) Deputy Director. The team will consists of three persons who will be responsible for one or more of the following functions:

1. ICT Manager - Technical Issues
2. Admin/ HR Manager - Insurance (or) Warranty claims, administrative issues, staff communications
3. Program Manager - Operation and project related issues
4. Finance Manager - Finance related issues

The basic requirements for the recovery plan are as followed:

- Disaster recovery team
- Disaster recovery documentation
- Backup computer facilities
- Disaster recovery site
- Disaster recovery alternate site

First step will include identifying a separate site where a computer will be set up in following order:

- Communications - re-establish an email connection for all focal persons within the organization
- Financial Systems - Restore financial data backed up before the disaster
- Administration - Restore connection between employees and re-establish human resources
